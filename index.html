            <aside id="sidebar">
                So this is where the problem starts. I don't know the topic for the webpage so I made the webpage regarding what this webpage contains.
            </aside>
            <section id="main">
                <h2>
                    DESCRIPTION
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the main area of the webpage. If I had known better I might have written some useful content here but here we are.
                    So lets discuss about what all this page has. It has some navigation links in the navigation bar. If you click it you might get to see the use of javascript
                    if I had time as I dont know if the future me will use javascript on this page or not.<br>
                    There must be a footer at the bottom as I thought that I would definetly put it. If you scroll the webpage the navigation pane sticks at the top.
                    Also I guess there is a watermark.
